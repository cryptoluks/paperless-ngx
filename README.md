# Paperless-ngx for ARM64 with ZXING Support

This repository houses Dockerfiles necessary for building amd64/arm64 Paperless-ngx images. Notably, these images also support zxing-cppâ€”a feature that the standard image for the arm64 platform [lacks](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/blob/e3257b8fa303a2e6ff9e31ff746212f171d98b5b/Pipfile#L59).

## How to Use the Image

To pull the latest version, use `ghcr.io/cryptoluks/paperless-ngx` as your image tag.

## Enabling Barcode Features

To utilize the ASN-barcode feature with the zxing library in the Paperless-ngx container, add the following environment variables:

```
PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_BARCODE_SCANNER=ZXING
PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_ENABLE_ASN_BARCODE=true
PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_ENABLE_BARCODES=true
```
